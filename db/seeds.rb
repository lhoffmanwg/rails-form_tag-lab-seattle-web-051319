# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
Student.create([{ first_name: "James", last_name: "Hathaway?"}, { first_name: "Kevin", last_name: "Hatahaway"}])
Student.create([{ first_name: "Sarah", last_name: "Hoffman"}, { first_name: "Joe", last_name: "Smith"}])
